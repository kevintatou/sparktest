## 🚀 How to Use

### For Repository Owner:

1. **Validate Configuration Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Set your values
   export DROPLET_IP="your.droplet.ip"
   export DROPLET_SSH_KEY="your-private-key"
   export GH_RUNNER_TOKEN="your-github-token"
   
   # Run validation
   ./scripts/validate-secrets.sh
   ```

2. **Set GitHub Repository Secrets**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/kevintatou/sparktest/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add each secret using the [SECRETS_SETUP.md](SECRETS_SETUP.md) guide

3. **Test Deployment**:
   - Push to main branch (for runner deployment)
   - Create release (for application deployment)
   - Monitor in GitHub Actions tab

### For Users/Contributors:

- Use [DEPLOYMENT_QUICKSTART.md](DEPLOYMENT_QUICKSTART.md) for quick setup
- Refer to [SECRETS_SETUP.md](SECRETS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
- Use the deployment issue template for reporting problems
