**SparkTest** is a lightweight, developer-focused test orchestrator for Kubernetes. Define tests as Docker containers, run them as Kubernetes Jobs, and view results in a clean, modern UI — no YAML editing required.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧪 **Test Definitions** – Reusable test configs with Docker image + command
- ⚙️ **Executors** – Predefined runners like K6, Postman, Playwright  
- 🚀 **Test Runs** – Launch containerized tests as Kubernetes Jobs
- 🧾 **Test Suites** – Group related tests and trigger them together
- 📂 **Git-backed Definitions** – Auto-register tests from `/tests/*.json`
- 💾 **Mock Mode** – Instant demo using localStorage
- 🦀 **Rust Backend** – Fast API layer using Axum + Kubernetes + PostgreSQL

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tech                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Frontend   | Next.js 14 App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui |
| Backend    | Rust (Axum), PostgreSQL, Kubernetes      |
| Testing    | Vitest, Playwright                       |
| CI/CD      | GitHub Actions, pnpm                     |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the UI.

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
cargo run
```

### 🎯 Want to Run Tests on Kubernetes?

**Quick Setup (5 minutes):**
```bash
# Install k3d (lightweight Kubernetes)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

# Create a local cluster
k3d cluster create sparktest

# Restart the backend - it will auto-detect Kubernetes!
cd backend && cargo run
```

Now your tests will run as Kubernetes Jobs and you'll see live logs in the UI! 

📚 [More details in the Kubernetes guide](backend/KUBERNETES.md)

### 🎯 Want to See Demo Data?

SparkTest includes comprehensive demo data with realistic testing scenarios:

- **Realistic Test Scenarios**: Jest, Cypress, Playwright, K6, OWASP security scans
- **Working Test Examples**: Self-contained tests that actually run through K8s
- **Production-Ready Examples**: Real-world configurations and test outputs

📖 [See the complete Demo Data Guide](DEMO_DATA_GUIDE.md)

### Testing & Coverage

SparkTest has comprehensive test coverage across both frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: 305+ unit tests using Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Backend**: 14+ tests using Rust's built-in test framework
- **Coverage**: Automatically tracked and reported via Codecov

```bash
# Frontend testing
cd apps/oss
pnpm test          # Run unit tests
pnpm test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
pnpm lint          # Run ESLint
pnpm type-check    # Run TypeScript checks

# Backend testing  
cd backend
cargo test          # Run all Rust tests
cargo llvm-cov      # Generate coverage report
```

**Coverage Reports**: Coverage is automatically uploaded to [Codecov](https://codecov.io) on every PR and push to main. The CI also generates detailed coverage reports showing exactly which lines, branches, and functions are covered by tests.
