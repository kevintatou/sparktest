## SparkTest v1.1.0 - Storage Service Improvements & Production Ready

### 🚀 Major Improvements

- **Standardized Storage Service Interface**: All storage implementations now use consistent method names:
  - `getTestSuites()`, `saveTestSuite()`, `deleteTestSuite()`, `getTestSuiteById()`
  - Updated all implementations: ApiStorageService, LocalStorageService, HybridStorageService, SparkTestStorageService

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Quality Improvements

- **TypeScript Compliance**: Fixed all TypeScript errors across the monorepo
- **Test Suite Compatibility**: All 305 tests now pass successfully
- **Code Quality**: Added comprehensive linting, formatting, and type checking
- **Build System**: All packages now build successfully without errors

### 🛠️ Developer Experience

- **Comprehensive Check Script**: Added `pnpm check` command that runs:
  - Format checking (Prettier)
  - Linting (ESLint)
  - Type checking (TypeScript)
  - Building (all packages + app)
  - Testing (305 NPM tests + 14 Rust tests)

### 📦 Infrastructure

- **Production Ready**: All CI/CD workflows verified and working
- **Clean Git History**: Standardized versioning across all packages
- **Rust Backend**: All backend tests passing (11 passed, 2 ignored integration tests)

### 🧪 Testing

- **Complete Test Coverage**: Storage service implementations thoroughly tested
- **Error Handling**: Improved fallback mechanisms in HybridStorageService
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript type annotations throughout

This release ensures SparkTest is production-ready with consistent APIs, comprehensive testing, and robust development workflows.
